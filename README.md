# BleichenbacherSignatureForger
Forge PKCS1v1.5 signature for questionable implementation of verification algorithms...

Intro
-----

This repository contains a Python 2 implementation of the Bleichenbacher signature forgery attack. Having seen this variant of the attack multiple times during the last year both in CTFs and in real implementations showed the need for a more general solution than the hacky frankenstein scripts I have laying around.

Usage
-----

``What, I don't know. There is no code yet!``
